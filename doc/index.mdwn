## About

The php-slurm/examples pages are basic and sparse, although they are
functional they do not fully meet the requirements of the HOWEST
internship requirements. With the php-slurm extension built along with
supporting PHP code and libraries, this project will focus on creating
a more interactive version of the basic site.

## Requirements
