<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>Installing amfphp for php-flash communication</h2>

<h3><a name="index1h3"></a>Warning : PHP Version</h3>

<p>Before installing <a href="http://amfphp.sourceforge.net/">amfphp</a>, make sure that your machine has at least
php version 4.0 installed.</p>

<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>Step 1 : Download amfphp</h3>

<p>Download a stable version of amfphp (slurm-flex-air uses amfphp
1.9)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>wget "http://sourceforge.net/projects/amfphp/files/amfphp/amfphp 1.9.zip"</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="index3h3"></a>Step 2 : Installing</h3>

<p>Unzip the file to your public html folder</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unzip "amfphp 1.9.zip" -d yourdirectory</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="index4h3"></a>Included amfphp - with the slurm services installed</h3>

<p>The installation of amfphp can be done by downloading the package from
their website and copying the contents of that folder into a public
html folder on your apache server. You would then define your php
files that you want visible to the outer world inside of the services
folder.</p>

<p>However, inside of the howest repository there is a folder called
amfphp_full_install containing the full amfphp that is at present
running under lonsdale's file system this folder also contains the
full services for both slurm_web and slurm_desktop ( slurm_web has
its Jobs functionality stripped out ).</p>

<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>Configuration of settings for FLURM application</h2>

<p>The installation of the application can be done by running the AIR
file.</p>

<p>During the installation deselect the "run after installation" option
and copy the settings file into the installation directory of your air
application.</p>

<p>The next step is the configuration of your settings file.</p>

<h3><a name="index5h3"></a>Settings file ( settings.xml ) :</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>url_gateway: contains the local url to your amfphp installation on your server</p>

<p>Example : ~vermeulp/amfphp/gateway.php</p>

<p>url_slurm_functions : contains the filename of your slurm
library file [Default = slurm.main]</p>

<ul>
<li>Sidenote : the syntax for this is slightly different from the
basic URL syntax slurm.main is actually slurm/main.php, so in other
words instead of having slashes you use a '.' and you leave out the
file extension.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>clusters: Contains the different clusters on your system, this section is
divided into cluster elements</p></li>
</ul>

<pre>
    cluster
        ----&gt;   name    :   The name of the cluster in the application
        ----&gt;   url :   The base url to your cluster  make
</pre>

<p>Example URL : http://lonsdale.tchpc.tcd.ie/</p>

<ul>
<li>refreshtimes: Rate in miliseconds at which you want live data to be
refreshed ( 30 000 is default ==&gt; 30 second refresh interval )</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="index1h4"></a>OSX</h4>

<p>On OSX, running the installer is straight forward. Once the install is completed,</p>

<pre><code>&#036; cp settings.xml /Applications/TCHPC_SLURM_AIR.app/Contents/
</code></pre>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>Compiled packages</h2>

<p>The binaries folder inside of the TCHPC repo contains
separate folders for both the web and desktop version of the
application.</p>

<h3><a name="index6h3"></a>flurm_Web</h3>

<p>The web folder has a directly deployable application available, it is
however important that you copy the contents of the ENTIRE folder onto
your webserver. As usual the settings file is available, however don't
move it into any subdirectory as it is already in its correct place.</p>

<h3><a name="index7h3"></a>flurm_Desktop</h3>

<p>The desktop folder contains a compiled air package and a settings
file. The installation can be done by running the air file and
deselecting the "run after installation" checkbox afterwards copy the
settings.xml file into the root of the installation directory ( on
windows machines this is usually in the Program Files or Program
Files(x86) directory ).</p>
